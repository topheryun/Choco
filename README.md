# Choco
Making an incremental game about chocolates in order to learn how to use Unity and C#. Current focus is on UI lists, events, and delegates.

The first stage of the game is to make an interactable list of buttons that show images of ingredients. Two ingredients are to be chosen and combined.

7.21.2019 Fixed Ingredient Display to show the buttons again, but they are not currently clickable for some reason. Added sprites for three chocolates. Added sprite for level 1 house.

7.23.2019 THE CURRENT VERSION HAS IngredientInventoryDisplay.cs PREFAB/SCRIPT NOT WORKING PROPERLY.

8.05.2019 IngredientInventoryDisplay.cs was fixed. Added GlobalParty.cs to keep track of everything. Combo.cs and ComboScreen.cs functions as a tool to display proper images for the ingredients and updates the lists.
